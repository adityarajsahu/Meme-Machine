        ### Inspiration
        In a world dominated by internet culture, memes have become one of the most effective tools of communication. But creating a timely, witty, and relevant meme still requires human effort and creativity. I wanted to explore what would happen if we gave that job entirely to AI, no human curation, just agents working together to create and publish humor in real-time. **The Meme Machine** was born out of this curiosity: could AI not only understand what's trending, but also turn that into something funny and safe to share?

        ### What it does
        The Meme Machine is a fully autonomous multi-agent system that:
        - Reviews user-submitted idea to ensure meme is appropriate and does not contain unethical or offensive content.
        - Searches relevent meme template from Imgflip.
        - Uses Google's Gemini API to generate funny caption based on user-submitted meme idea.
        - Composes the meme by combining the meme template and the generated caption.
        - Publishes the meme on to Reddit.

        ### How we built it
        I used Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build a multi-agent workflow where each agent has a specialized role. Each agent handles a single responsibility, and overall workflow is orchestrated by a combination of **ParallelAgent** and **SequentialAgent** that ties everything together. This multi-agent system was developed using:
        - **FastAPI** for serving the multi-agent system.
        - **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model for sentence embedding.
        - **OpenCV** for image processing.
        - **praw** for posting memes to Reddit.

        ### Challenges we ran into
        - **ADK Orchestration:** Coordinating state between agents in a sequential pipeline using ADK required careful state management.
        - **Content Moderation:** Reviewing the user-submitted idea to ensure ethical use of AI for content generation.
        - **Deployment:** Ensuring the service ran smoothly took several iterations.

        ### Accomplishments that we're proud of
        - Developed a fully working, end-to-end meme generation and publishing system from scratch.
        - Successfully integrated five distinct AI agents into a unified pipeline.
        - Learned and implemented Google's brand-new ADK framework in a real-world use case.

        ### What we learned
        - How to design modular, agent-based architecture using ADK.
        - Best practices for API-based content generation and moderation.
        - How to process and combine data in a creative application.
        - Deployment strategies on cloud platforms.

        ### What's next for The Meme Machine
        - **Instagram & Twitter Support:** Extended publishing capabilities beyond Reddit.
        - **Fine-tuned humor model:** Incorporate reinforcement learning from human feedback to mimic human-like humor.
        - **Content Generation & Management for Content Creators:** Develop an integrated platform that assists content creators by suggesting fresh content ideas, generating structured roadmaps for content production, whether based on creator input or brand-specific promotional requirements, automatically creating the content, providing clear guidance for capturing photos or videos when needed, assembling the final content, and managing publication according to a set schedule.
